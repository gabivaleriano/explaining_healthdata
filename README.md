# explaining_healthdata

This repository contains resources for analyzing and generating **instance-level footprints** from healthcare datasets, considering different levels of **instance hardness**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- 🧪 **Notebook**: 1 Jupyter notebook
- 📄 **Files**: 4 `.csv` files and 1 `.pdf` file

---

## 📓 Notebook

### `experiments_footprints.ipynb`

This notebook contains experiments in which we generate **instance footprints** based on **varying levels of instance hardness**. These footprints are intended to support research into explainability and model behavior across heterogeneous healthcare data.

---

## 📂 CSV Files

The four `.csv` files contain the datasets used in the experiments. They reflect real-world healthcare data, preprocessed for machine learning tasks.

---

## 📄 PDF File

The `.pdf` document provides:

- A **description of the datasets** used in the experiments
- A summary of **analysis results and key insights**

---

## 📚 Looking for Refined Datasets?

A more refined and better-documented version of these healthcare datasets is available in the [**healthdatabr** repository](https://github.com/gabivaleriano/healthdatabr).  
It includes:

- Preprocessing steps guided by clinicians  
- Summary statistics and baseline ML models  
- Documentation for each dataset
